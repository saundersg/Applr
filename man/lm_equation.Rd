\title{Write out the equation of a linear model}
\usage{
lm_equation(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A linear model}
}
\value{
The equation of an indicated linear model with coefficients and variable names
}
\description{
Takes a fitted linear model and returns a human-readable equation string showing
the relationship between the response variable and predictors. This is useful for
presenting model results in reports or understanding the mathematical form of the model.
Coefficients are rounded to 3 significant figures for readability.
