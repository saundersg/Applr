\title{Plot a 3D-grapheable linear model}
\usage{
scatter_3d(model, n = 100, colors = c("blue", "yellow"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A saved linear model with 2 predictor variables}

\item{n}{Number of evaluations for creating the surface grid}

\item{colors}{Colors used for the gradient scale}
}
\value{
A 3D graph in the viewer section
}
\description{
Creates an interactive 3D visualization of a linear model with exactly 2 predictor variables.
The function plots the original data points as scattered points in 3D space and overlays
a semi-transparent regression surface showing the model predictions across the entire
predictor space. This provides an intuitive way to understand how a linear model
behaves across different combinations of two predictor variables.
