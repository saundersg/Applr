\description{
A custom ggplot2 theme that provides a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing color scheme
and styling for statistical graphics. This theme sets both default geom aesthetics
and plot theme elements to create a consistent visual style across all plots.
The color palette uses warm, earthy tones that work well for academic and professional
presentations.
