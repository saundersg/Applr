# CASE: as_18_err_wrong_data_plot
# TYPE: console
# FUNC: add_slice_2d
# EXPECT: Scatter plot with a line that doesn't represent the model. 
#         This test should correctly produce bad output, showing the limits 
#         of the function due to base R's painter sytem for drawing plots. 
#         Adding a slice from one model onto a plot of ENTIRELY different
#         data. Ideally a warning that the ranges don't match; currently the
#         line is drawn silently (review the plot in the report).
