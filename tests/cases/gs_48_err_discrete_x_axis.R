# CASE: gs_48_err_discrete_x_axis
# TYPE: console
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: A factor predictor mapped to the x-axis makes the x scale discrete;
#         geom_slice needs a continuous axis to draw a line. A clear error:
#         "geom_slice() needs a continuous x-axis, but the x scale is
#         discrete." (imputation messages for the held variable may print
#         first).
