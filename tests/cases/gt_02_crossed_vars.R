# CASE: gt_02_crossed_vars
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice_text
# EXPECT: Six parallel skyblue slices — x2 in {0, 2, 4} crossed with x3 in
#         {0, 1} — which without labels would be indistinguishable. Each line's
#         right end carries a two-variable label joined with "; ":
#         "x2: 0; x3: 0", "x2: 0; x3: 1", ..., "x2: 4; x3: 1".
#         Labels are skyblue, one per line, none overlapping badly, all at the
#         same constant gap past their line ends; the geom widens the x-range
#         itself to fit the longest label.
