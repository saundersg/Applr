# CASE: gs_25_scale_y_log10
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: Model y ~ x with the y-axis displayed through scale_y_log10().
#         Data is noise-free (y = 3*x + 2 exactly, R^2 = 1), so the slice must
#         pass exactly through every point: on the log10 axis the line appears
#         as a rising curve that flattens to the right (log-looking), NOT a
#         straight line. No errors.
