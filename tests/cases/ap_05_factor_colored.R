# CASE: ap_05_factor_colored
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: autoplot
# EXPECT: iris scatter (Petal.Length vs Sepal.Length). Species is a non-numeric
#         second predictor, so autoplot shows it as colour rather than imputing
#         it: THREE slice lines (setosa/versicolor/virginica), each over its own
#         petal range, each with its own confidence ribbon in its line's colour.
#         Console: one "Coloured by Species" message.
