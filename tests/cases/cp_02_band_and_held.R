# CASE: cp_02_band_and_held
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice_caption
# EXPECT: The caption twin of sb_13. A projection band on x2 (1 to 4) with a
#         THIRD predictor x3 pinned at a single value (2). The CAPTION
#         (bottom-right, right-aligned) reports both, each with its own
#         wording: line 1 the model equation, line 2 "held at: x3 = 2",
#         line 3 "projection band: x2 spanning 1-4". Pinned values keep the
#         "held at:" wording; only the banded variable uses "spanning".
