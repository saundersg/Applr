# CASE: gs_18_impute_types
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: ONE straight line, plus THREE console messages naming each imputed value:
#         z_num (numeric) -> mean (~50), w_fac (factor) -> mode ("a"),
#         s_chr (character) -> mode ("p").
#
# Impute-type coverage, isolated from grouping/faceting. Model:
#   y ~ x + z_num + w_fac + s_chr   — a single additive slice.
#   x is the axis; the other three predictors are NOT shown and must be imputed.
#
#   COVERAGE NOTE: geom_slice currently implements only mean (numeric) and mode
#   (factor/character). min / max / median imputation are NOT implemented (see the
#   impute item in for_devs/dev_todo.Rmd) and therefore cannot be tested yet — when
#   that feature lands, add gs_ cases exercising each new impute method.
