# CASE: sb_12_band_spanning
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice_subtitle
# EXPECT: One projection band (x2 from 1 to 4, band = TRUE) on a skyblue
#         slice pair. The subtitle reports the banded variable with range
#         wording instead of the pinned-value wording: line 1 the model
#         equation, line 2 "projection band: x2 spanning 1-4". Variables pinned
#         to a single value would still use the "held at:" wording.
