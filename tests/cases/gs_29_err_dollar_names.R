# CASE: gs_29_err_dollar_names
# TYPE: console
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: A model fit as lm(df$y ~ df$x): either work or fail with a clear
#         message about "$" in variable names. Currently imputes both
#         "df_with_dollar$y" and "df_with_dollar$x" as held variables (with
#         messages) and warns about newdata row counts — review.
