# CASE: gs_12_real_data_two_predictors
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: mtcars scatter (disp vs mpg). Model is mpg ~ disp + hp.
#         One fitted line with hp held at its mean (~146).
#         Line should slope downward (more displacement -> less mpg) and pass
#         through the middle of the point cloud.
#         Console message: hp not specified, held at its mean (146.7).
#         No errors.
