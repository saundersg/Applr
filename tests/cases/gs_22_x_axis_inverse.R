# CASE: gs_22_x_axis_inverse
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: Model y ~ I(1/x), plotted with 1/x on the x-axis. Data is noise-free
#         (y = 5/x + 2 exactly, R^2 = 1), so the slice must be ONE straight
#         line of slope 5 and intercept 2, passing exactly through every
#         point. No errors.
