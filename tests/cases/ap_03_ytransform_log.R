# CASE: ap_03_ytransform_log
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: autoplot
# EXPECT: autoplot's all.vars() strips the response transform, so the y-axis
#         is RAW mpg even though the model is log(mpg) ~ disp. geom_slice
#         must auto back-transform (console message): one smooth decreasing
#         exp() curve through the raw-scale point cloud, not a straight line.
#         Its default confidence ribbon is back-transformed with it, so the
#         band follows the curve and is asymmetric about it.
