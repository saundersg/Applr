# CASE: gs_24_scale_x_log10
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: Model y ~ x with the x-axis displayed through scale_x_log10().
#         Data is noise-free (y = 2*x + 10 exactly, R^2 = 1), so the slice
#         must pass exactly through every point: on the log10 axis the line
#         appears as a steepening upward curve (exponential-looking), NOT a
#         straight line. No errors.
