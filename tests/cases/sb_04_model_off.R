# CASE: sb_04_model_off
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice_subtitle
# EXPECT: Same slice as sb_01 (x2 imputed at its mean), but called with
#         model = FALSE: the equation line is dropped, so the subtitle is the
#         single line "held at: x2 = <mean>".
#         Console message: x2 not specified, held at its mean (~2.385).
