# CASE: gs_40_back_transform_fn
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: Same data and model as gs_11 (1/y ~ x, original y scale), but with
#         an EXPLICIT back_transform = \(z) 1/z instead of auto-detection.
#         The fitted line must be the same decreasing hyperbolic curve as
#         gs_11. A straight line means the explicit function was ignored.
