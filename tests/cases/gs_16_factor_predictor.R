# CASE: gs_16_factor_predictor
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# EXPECT: mtcars scatter (disp vs mpg), model mpg ~ factor(cyl) + disp.
#         geom_slice called without predict_vars — cyl imputed to its most
#         common level ("8", 14 of 32 cars), reported by a console message.
#         One line corresponding to the cyl=8 slice.
#         Tests that geom_slice handles factor predictors without crashing.
#         No errors. (If it crashes, factor handling in predict() is the likely culprit.)
