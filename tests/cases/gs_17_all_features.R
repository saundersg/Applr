# CASE: gs_17_all_features
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# SIZE: 10x4
# EXPECT: 3 panels (F1, F2, F3), each with TWO dashed lines of width 1.2 colored
#         by g: the G2 line steeper (slope ~3) than the G1 line (slope ~1).
#         Panel intercepts step up F1 < F2 < F3 (~0, ~10, ~20). Held vars z/w/s
#         are imputed (3 console messages) and do not appear on the plot.
#         If every line within a panel has the SAME slope, the grouping variable
#         g was wrongly imputed instead of taken from the color group.
#
# The full-feature integration test — every geom_slice capability in one plot.
#   Model: y ~ x*g + f + z + w + s   (synthetic, fully balanced so every f x g cell is populated)
#     - x : numeric x-axis
#     - g : color grouping (2 levels, INTERACTS with x -> different slopes per group)
#     - f : faceting variable, DIFFERENT from g (3 levels, additive -> different intercepts)
#     - z : numeric   held var, NOT shown -> imputed at mean   (~50)
#     - w : factor    held var, NOT shown -> imputed at mode   ("w1")
#     - s : character held var, NOT shown -> imputed at mode   ("s1")
#   Plot: facet_wrap(~f); color = g; dashed lines (linetype) of linewidth 1.2 (styling).
#
#   This is the integration stress test: grouping + faceting together is the combination
#   the SliceLayer structural issue (see for_devs/known_issues.Rmd) is expected to break.
