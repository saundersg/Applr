# CASE: as_03_multiplicative
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: add_slice_2d
# EXPECT: Model y ~ I(x*x_pos), plotted with the product x*x_pos on the x-axis.
#         x_axis = "x * x_pos" (composite mode) draws one straight slice line
#         of slope ~1 through the points. Silent: every predictor is on the
#         x-axis, nothing is held. (The default x_axis would pick the first
#         raw variable `x` — wrong for this plot — so it is specified.)
