# CASE: gt_05_location_left
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice_text
# EXPECT: Two parallel skyblue slices (x2 held at 0 and 4) with
#         location = "left": the "x2: 0" / "x2: 4" labels sit just past the
#         LEFT end of each line (right-aligned toward the line), not the
#         right; the x-range expansion moves to the left side accordingly.
