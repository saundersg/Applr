# CASE: gs_41_back_transform_string

# EXPECT: Same data and model as gs_09 (log(y) ~ x_pos, original y scale),
#         but with the NAMED-STRING form back_transform = "log" (meaning the
#         response was log-transformed, so predictions are exp()'d) instead
#         of auto-detection. The fitted line must be the same upward
#         exponential curve as gs_09. A straight line = FAIL.
