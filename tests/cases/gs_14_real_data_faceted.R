# CASE: gs_14_real_data_faceted
# TYPE: visual
# FUNC: geom_slice
# SIZE: 10x4
# EXPECT: Three facet panels for cyl = 4, 6, 8 (mtcars).
#         Model is mpg ~ disp + hp + cyl.
#         Each panel shows a steelblue downward-sloping line at hp=110.
#         The lines must be positioned correctly for each cylinder level:
#         cyl=4 panel at higher mpg, cyl=6 in the middle, cyl=8 at lower mpg.
#         Lines should NOT be identical across panels (cyl matters).
#         No errors.
