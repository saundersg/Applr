# geom_slice_subtitle() — a plot subtitle describing the geom_slice() layers.
#
# Architecture (mirrors geom_slice_text.R):
#
#   geom_slice_subtitle()  validates user input and returns a
#                          `slice_subtitle_spec`. It takes NO model or
#                          predict_vars — those are borrowed from the plot's
#                          existing geom_slice() layers at add time.
#   ggplot_add.slice_subtitle_spec
#                          scans plot$layers for slice layers, warns when there
#                          are none or when they use different models, works out
#                          which held values are NOT already labeled elsewhere
#                          on the plot (geom_slice_text labels, the legend,
#                          facet strips), and sets the plot subtitle.
#
# The subtitle is add-time text, not a layer: everything it reports (imputed
# means, predict_vars, what the legend covers) is knowable from the plot object
# before it is built, mirroring the held-variable logic of build_slice_spec().

#' Describe the lines drawn by geom_slice() in the plot subtitle
#'
#' `geom_slice_subtitle()` fills the plot subtitle with a description of the
#' plot's [geom_slice()] layers: the model equation ([lm_equation()] style) on
#' the first line, and the held values the plot does not otherwise show on the
#' second (`"held at: x2 = 2.507"`, formatted like `geom_slice()`'s console
#' messages).
#'
#' It takes no `model` or `predict_vars` — everything is borrowed from the
#' plot's existing `geom_slice()` layers, so add it *after* them (and after
#' any [geom_slice_text()]). The held-values line is conscious of what the
#' plot already labels: variables labeled by `geom_slice_text()`, pinned by a
#' grouping aesthetic (the legend covers those), or pinned by faceting are
#' left out. User-chosen `predict_vars` values and imputed defaults are
#' treated the same — both are unlabeled held values. When nothing is held,
#' the line is dropped entirely.
#'
#' @param model If `TRUE` (default), the subtitle's first line is the model
#'   equation; `FALSE` drops it, leaving only the held-values line.
#' @param prepend,append Plain strings pasted before the first line and after
#'   the last line of the default subtitle.
#' @param ... Passed to [lm_equation()] when the equation is written, under
#'   its own argument names — chiefly `style`, which controls how factor terms
#'   are labelled.
#'
#'   Left unset, `style` is chosen to fit: with `wrap` on, the equation is
#'   tried spelled out (`4.09*(Species="setosa")`) and briefly
#'   (`4.09*[setosa]`), each with and without the hanging indent, preferring
#'   the spelled-out form and giving up the indent last. The first that fits
#'   wins, and a message says so if the brief form did. Because the indent
#'   goes last, a narrower plot can bring the full names *back*. The brief
#'   form is never offered when two terms would shorten to the same label — a
#'   bare `[High]` from two different factors no longer says which it meant.
#'
#'   Naming `style` yourself pins it and switches all of that off. Pin it (or
#'   give `wrap` a width) when the annotation must come out the same whatever
#'   size device it is drawn on.
#' @param wrap Controls wrapping of lines too long to fit. `TRUE` (default)
#'   measures how much room the subtitle has in this plot on the current
#'   graphics device and breaks long lines to fit, between terms only, with
#'   continuation lines hanging under the right-hand side of the equal sign.
#'   `FALSE` leaves the text as one line per item, however far it runs off the
#'   plot. A number is a width in inches to wrap to instead of measuring —
#'   useful when the plot will be drawn at a size other than the current
#'   device, as with `ggsave(width = )`.
#'
#' @returns An object that sets the plot subtitle when added to a ggplot.
#'
#' @seealso [geom_slice()] for the layers being described;
#'   [geom_slice_caption()] for the same text in the caption;
#'   [geom_slice_text()] to label the lines themselves.
