#' Plot a 3D-graphable linear model
#'
#' Creates an interactive 3D visualization of a linear model with exactly two
#' predictor variables. The model's own data is drawn as scattered points and a
#' semi-transparent regression surface is overlaid across the whole predictor
#' space, so you can *see* the fitted surface rather than read its coefficients.
#'
#' Reach for it when a model has exactly two predictors and you want to
#' understand how it behaves across their combinations. Transformed terms are
#' fine — the surface is evaluated with [predict()] on the raw predictors, so
#' `lm(z ~ x + I(x^2) + y)` graphs over `x` and `y` as expected.
#'
#' @param model A fitted [lm()] with exactly two numeric predictor variables.
#' @param n Number of grid points along each predictor axis used to evaluate
#'   the prediction surface (default 100); larger values give a smoother
#'   surface at the cost of speed.
#' @param colors Character vector defining the marker color gradient, mapped to
#'   the response value so points read from low to high.
#'
#' @returns A plotly object (an interactive 3D plot). When printed — e.g. at
#'   the console or in RStudio — it renders in the Viewer pane.
