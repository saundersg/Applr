# 2D Slicer

Take a linear model and display a 2D slice in base R. This function
creates a new plot comparing the response y variable with one predictor
x variable and displaying a linear model line with all other predictor
variables held at constant values. For unspecified variables, the x_axis
is assumed to be the first predictor in the model and all other variable
are imputed (mean for numeric, first level for factors).

## Usage

``` r
slice_2d(
  model,
  x_axis = NULL,
  n = 100,
  caption = TRUE,
  back_transform = TRUE,
  interval = "none",
  ...,
  xaxis = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  A linear model

- x_axis:

  A non-required specification of the x-axis variable; default is the
  first x var in the lm. May also be an expression of the model's
  predictors, such as `x_axis = "x * x_pos"`, in which case predictions
  are made at the model's own data points and placed at the expression's
  value.

- n:

  Number of displayed points; default is 100

- caption:

  Boolean to include caption with values of predictor variables not
  shown in the chart, TRUE by default

- back_transform:

  How to map predictions onto the y-axis when the model's response is
  transformed. Default `TRUE` auto-detects from the model formula;
  `FALSE` turns back-transformation off; a one-argument function (e.g.
  `exp`) or a name (`"log"`, `"log10"`, `"log2"`, `"sqrt"`, `"exp"`,
  `"inverse"`) applies that transformation.

- interval:

  Draw a shaded band around the line: `"none"` (default), or
  `"confidence"` / `"prediction"` for the corresponding
  [`predict.lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.lm.html) interval.

- ...:

  Remaining vars (color, linetype, etc.)

- xaxis:

  Deprecated; use `x_axis` instead.

## Value

A 2D graph of a sliced model

## Examples

``` r
model <- lm(log(mpg) ~ disp + hp, data = mtcars)
slice_2d(model)
#> X-axis not specified - Used first x variable as x-axis
#>     To specify, use 'x_axis = "var_name"' such as 'x_axis = "disp"'
#> Value for `hp` not specified - Used mean: 146.7
#>     To specify, use 'var_name = value', such as 'hp = 146.7'


# Choose the x-axis, hold disp at a value, and style the line
slice_2d(model, x_axis = "hp", disp = 250, n = 150, col = "blue", lwd = 2)


# With a 95% confidence band around the line
slice_2d(model, interval = "confidence")
#> X-axis not specified - Used first x variable as x-axis
#>     To specify, use 'x_axis = "var_name"' such as 'x_axis = "disp"'
#> Value for `hp` not specified - Used mean: 146.7
#>     To specify, use 'var_name = value', such as 'hp = 146.7'
