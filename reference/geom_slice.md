# Display a 2D slice of a linear model

`geom_slice()` draws the prediction line of a fitted
[`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html) on a ggplot — a 2D *slice* of
a possibly high-dimensional model. It looks like
[`ggplot2::geom_smooth()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html),
but where
[`geom_smooth()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html)
fits its own model to the plotted data, `geom_slice()` draws *your*
model. The predictor mapped to the plot's x-axis varies along the line;
every other predictor is fixed, and `geom_slice()` reports how, so it is
always clear which slice of the model you are looking at:

## Usage

``` r
geom_slice(
  model,
  n = 100,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  predict_vars = list(),
  back_transform = NULL,
  interval = "none",
  band = FALSE,
  full_range = FALSE,
  ...,
  fullrange = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  A linear model fitted by [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html).

- n:

  Number of prediction points along the line (default 100).

- inherit.aes:

  If `TRUE` (default), inherit aesthetics from the
  [`ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html)
  call.

- predict_vars:

  A named list of values at which to hold predictors not shown on the
  plot, such as `predict_vars = list(hp = 110)`. Unlisted predictors are
  imputed (with a message). Giving a variable several values draws one
  line per value, and several multi-value variables are crossed:
  `predict_vars = list(x2 = c(1, 2, 3), x3 = c(1, 4))` draws 6 lines.

- back_transform:

  How to map predictions onto the y-axis when the model's response is
  transformed. Default `NULL` (and `TRUE`) auto-detects from the model
  formula; `FALSE` turns back-transformation off; a one-argument
  function (e.g. `exp`) or a name (`"log"`, `"log10"`, `"log2"`,
  `"sqrt"`, `"exp"`, `"inverse"`) applies that transformation.

- interval:

  Draw a ribbon around the line: `"none"` (default), or `"confidence"` /
  `"prediction"` for the corresponding
  [`predict.lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.lm.html) interval.
  The ribbon follows its line's color unless you set `fill`. Cannot be
  combined with `band`.

- band:

  Draw a *projection band* — two edge slices with a translucent ribbon
  between them — instead of a single line. `band = "variable"` spans
  that predictor: between the values you gave in `predict_vars` (e.g.
  `predict_vars = list(x2 = c(1, 4))`), or its observed data range when
  `predict_vars` leaves it out. `band = TRUE` infers the variable: the
  one multi-value `predict_vars` entry, or the single predictor the plot
  does not otherwise show. Default `FALSE`.

- full_range, fullrange:

  If `TRUE`, each line spans the full x range of the panel instead of
  stopping at its group's own data range (like `fullrange` in
  [`ggplot2::geom_smooth()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html);
  `fullrange` is accepted as an alias). Default `FALSE`. Only applies
  when the x-axis maps a single predictor; with a composite x-axis
  expression predictions are made at the data points, so the lines keep
  their data extent.

- ...:

  Other arguments passed to the layer, such as fixed aesthetics
  (`color = "red"`, `linewidth = 1.2`).

## Value

A ggplot2 layer that draws the slice.

## Details

- Variables named in `predict_vars` are held at your chosen values.

- Variables mapped to a grouping aesthetic (e.g. `aes(color = g)`) are
  pinned to each group's own value — one line per group. Any `interval`
  or `band` ribbon is drawn in its own line's color.

- Facet variables are pinned to each panel's value.

- Anything left over is *imputed* (mean for numeric, most common value
  for factor/character), with a console message naming the value used.

If the model's response is transformed (e.g. `lm(log(y) ~ x)`) but the
plot shows raw `y`, predictions are automatically back-transformed to
match the y-axis (a message says so). Axis expressions (`aes(log(y))`,
`aes(x * x2)`) and transformed scales
([`scale_x_log10()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html))
are also handled.

## Examples

``` r
library(ggplot2)

# Basic use, like geom_smooth() but drawing *your* model. hp is not on
# the plot, so it is held at its mean (a console message says so).
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp, data = mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model)
#> Value for `hp` not specified - Used mean: 146.7
#>     To choose a slice, use 'predict_vars = list(hp = 146.7)'.


# Choose the slice yourself
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model, predict_vars = list(hp = 110))


# Several values draw one line per value (label them with
# geom_slice_text()); several multi-value variables are crossed
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model, predict_vars = list(hp = c(66, 150, 335)))


# Confidence or prediction ribbon around the line
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model, predict_vars = list(hp = 110), interval = "confidence")


# A grouping aesthetic pins its predictor to each group's own value:
# one line per cylinder count, each with its own slope
model2 <- lm(mpg ~ disp * cyl, data = mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model2)


# full_range = TRUE extends each group's line across the whole panel,
# not just its own data range
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model2, full_range = TRUE)


# Facet variables pin per panel the same way
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model2) +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl)


# A transformed response is back-transformed automatically: the model
# predicts log(mpg), the line appears in raw mpg units (a message says so)
model3 <- lm(log(mpg) ~ disp + hp, data = mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model3)
#> Value for `hp` not specified - Used mean: 146.7
#>     To choose a slice, use 'predict_vars = list(hp = 146.7)'.
#> Predictions of `log(mpg)` were back-transformed to match the `mpg` axis.
#>     To turn this off, use 'back_transform = FALSE'.


# ... or control the mapping yourself with back_transform
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model3, back_transform = exp)
#> Value for `hp` not specified - Used mean: 146.7
#>     To choose a slice, use 'predict_vars = list(hp = 146.7)'.


# A projection band spanning hp between two values, instead of a line
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model, predict_vars = list(hp = c(66, 335)), band = "hp")


# n controls how many prediction points make up the line
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_slice(model, predict_vars = list(hp = 110), n = 10)
